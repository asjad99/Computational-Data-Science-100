# Computational Data Science - Big Ideas and Metal Models 


### About


Welcome to the Data Science Learning Notebooks repository! This project serves as a comprehensive resource for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts looking to learn and deepen their understanding of data science concepts. The repository features a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering both fundamental and advanced topics in data science, blending theoretical insights with practical applications.

**Why Data Science?**

Data Science is the art of transforming raw data into actionable insights and data-driven products. These products empower decision-makers by providing clear, actionable information while abstracting away the complexities of underlying data and analytics. Examples of such products include:

- Buy/Sell Strategies for financial instruments
- Product Optimization Actions to enhance manufacturing yield or improve marketing efforts
- Logistics Optimization Solutions to streamline operations

The foundation of effective data science lies in understanding the data you have and what it reveals inductively. 

Questions like the following can be addressed with well-designed data products:

- Which of my products should I promote to maximize profit?
- How can I improve compliance programs while reducing costs?
- What process changes can help build a better product?

By learning data science, you gain the ability to create algorithmic products and services, such as recommendation systems, customer engagement optimizers, trend detectors, and many others. These systems enhance business capabilities and drive innovation.

#### The Journey of Data Science and Computing 

The discipline of computer science, which forms the bedrock of data science, has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1960s. Early focuses included programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and foundational mathematical theories. By the 1970s, algorithms and their practical applications became a central focus. Over the decades, this emphasis shifted to reflect the convergence of computing, communication technologies, and the explosion of data generation.

Today, the focus is on extracting actionable insights from massive datasets rather than solving strictly defined problems. This shift highlights the growing importance of:

**Probability and Statistics**
**Numerical Methods**
**Machine Learning and AI Algorithms**

These areas enable us to tackle challenges presented by large-scale data, internet applications, and social networks.

**What This Repository Offers:**

### Notable Quotes

“We’re entering a new world in which data may be more important than software.” — Tim O’Reilly

“You can best learn data mining and data science by doing, so start analyzing data as soon as you can! However, don’t forget to learn the theory, since you need a good statistical and machine learning foundation to understand what you are doing and to find real nuggets of value in the noise of big data.”

“The best way to learn data science is to do data science.” — Chanin Nantasenamat

“The era of Data Technology is here and it will surpass the Information Technology era. The DT era is about transparency, sharing of information and enabling others. Alibaba is excited about the possibilities of the DT era and how it can bring value to society.” — Jack Ma

“Many believe that Big Data is over-hyped, but seeing the fantastic use cases popping up around the globe I would say Big Data is under-hyped! In the coming years, Big Data will revolutionize every industry unlike we have seen before!”

“I like to think of data as the new soil, Get in and get your hands dirty.” — David McCandless

“Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.” — Josh Wills

“Despite an awful lot of marketing hype, big data are here to stay and big data analytics (i.e. data science and statistics) will remain aids to human thinking and not replacements for it!” — Diego Kuonen

“For me, data science is a mix of three things: quantitative analysis (for the rigor necessary to understand your data), programming (so that you can process your data and act on your insights), and storytelling (to help others understand what the data means).” — Edwin Chen
